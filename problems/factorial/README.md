# Factorial

The [factorial] of a positive integer 𝑛 is the product of all positive integers
less than or equal to 𝑛: 

𝑛! = 𝑛 × (𝑛 − 1) × (𝑛 − 2) × (𝑛 − 3) × ⋯ × 3 × 2 × 1

For example:

5 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 20

The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an [empty product].

Write a looping and recursive function that calculates the factorial.

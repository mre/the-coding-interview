Given a M x N matrix containing letters and spaces, find all valid english
words. You can only access the adjacent cells at each position i.e. go left,
right, up and down.

Example:

_ s o
_ h l
_ e l

Possible results: ["so", "she", "he", "hell", "hello"]
                  ["so", "she", "solo", "he", "hell", "hello"]

Follow up questions:
What are the possible termination conditions?
Can I use the same letter more than once?

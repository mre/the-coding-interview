# Atbash

[Atbash] is a simple substitution cipher originally for the Hebrew alphabet, but
possible with any known alphabet.

Original: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
Substitute: `zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba`

So you would substitute `a` in your input text with `Z` in your output text,
`b` with `Y`, `c` with `X` and so forth.

A few English words also _Atbash_ into other English words:

* irk = rip
* low = old
* hob = sly
* hold = slow
* holy = slob
* horn = slim
* glow = told
* grog = tilt
* zoo = all

Some other English words _Atbash_ into their own reverses, e.g. _wizard_ becomes
_draziw_.

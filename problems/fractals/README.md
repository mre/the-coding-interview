# Fractals
Fractals are complex geometric shapes or patterns that display self-similarity and have a non-integer dimension. This means that the pattern or shape of the object repeats itself at different scales or levels of magnification. Fractals are often characterized by their intricate and detailed structures, which can be seen when the object is magnified or zoomed in.

Fractals are found in many natural phenomena such as coastlines, clouds, snowflakes, and trees, and they can also be generated using mathematical formulas. Fractal geometry has been applied in a variety of fields, including computer graphics, art, architecture, physics, biology, and finance.

In this tutorials we will going through differents shapes with fractal like properties i.e. can be build from simple iteratives mathematics rules.
## Example
```
The Mandelbrot set which generated by a simple mathematical formula
And produces highly detailed and intricate pattern

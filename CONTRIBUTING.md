# Finding missing solutions

If you’re looking for problems that don’t have solutions yet in the language of
your choice, try running the [find-missing-solutions](find-missing-solutions)
script. Pass it the file extension for your language of choice, and it will
search the problem directories for problems that don’t yet have a solution in
that language.

Sample usage: `./find-missing-solutions py`
